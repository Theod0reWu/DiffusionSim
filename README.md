# DiffusionSim
Diffusion Simulation using particle dynamics
<br>
Includes discretized simulations following ficks law, brownian motion modeled by random walks (wierner process) and step-based simulations of elastic collisions.
The graph below shows the concentrations of a disretized simulation in a 1-D line.

The gif shows the same simulation but with the wierner process:
